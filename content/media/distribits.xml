      <title>Git annex recipes</title>
      <abstract>
        I have come up with many recipes over the years for scaling
        git-annex repositories in terms of large numbers of keys,
        large file sizes, and increased transfer efficiency.

        I have working examples that I use internally that I can demonstrate.

        (1) Second-order keys; using metadata to describe keys that
        can be derived from other keys. I primarily used this to help
        with the problem of too many keys referencing small
        files. This is building off of the work of others, but I
        believe I have made useful improvements, and I would like to
        polish it up and share it.

        One very early example is here:
        https://github.com/unqueued/repo.macintoshgarden.org-fileset/
        For now, I stripped out all but the location data from the
        git-annex branch.  Files smaller than 50M are contained in
        second-order keys (8b0b0af8-5e76-449c-b0ae-766fcac0bc58). The
        other uuids are for standard backends, including a Google
        Drive account which has very strict limits on requests, and it
        would have been very difficult to process over 10k keys
        directly.  There are also other cases where keys can be
        reliably reproduced from other keys.

        (2) Differential storage with git-annex using bup (or borg). I
        built of off posts on the forums from years ago, and came up
        with some really useful workflows for combining the benefits
        of git-annex location tracking and branching with differential
        compression. I have scripts used for automation, and some
        example repos and case studies. For example, I have a repo
        which contains file indexes that are over 60GiB, but only
        consume about 6GiB, using bup packfiles. I can benefit from
        differential compression over different time ranges, like per
        year, or for the entire history, while minimizing storage
        usage. I will publish a working example in the next few weeks,
        but I have only used it internally for years.

      <title>"git annex is complete, right?"</title>
      <abstract>
        My father has asked me this question before over the years. So
        has an experienced developer recently. Seeing the same
        question from two such different perspectives got me asking it
        of myself.

        While a new data storage system can always be added to
        git-annex, or a new command be added to improve some use case,
        both of those can also be accomplished without needing changes
        to git-annex, by external remotes and more targeted frontends
        such as Datalad.

        So what then is the potential surface area of problem space
        that git-annex may expand to cover? Do diminishing returns and
        complexity make such expansions a good idea? I will explore
        this by considering recent developments in git-annex, and the
        impact of lesser-used features.

      <title>OpenNeuro and DataLad</title>
      <abstract>
        A history of OpenNeuro's adoption of DataLad and the evolution
        of DataLad and git-annex support on the platform. In 2017
        OpenNeuro was preparing to launch with the original data
        backend implemented as block storage without git-annex. The
        decision was made to move OpenNeuro to DataLad and a quick
        prototype for this backend service was created and eventually
        brought to production for the public release of OpenNeuro.
        \n\n
        Since 2017 the platform has evolved to support many of the
        unique advantages of DataLad datasets. This talk discusses the
        architecture of OpenNeuro, some of the challenges encountered
        using git-annex as the center of our application’s data model
        in cloud environments, solutions developed, and future work to
        improve upon OpenNeuro’s archival and distribution of DataLad
        datasets.
