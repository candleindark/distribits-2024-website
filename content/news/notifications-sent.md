We have sent out notifications by email to all who submitted conference
and hackathon submissions. However, if you missed the registration deadline, don't worry! It is now possible to
[submit a late registration](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/jnreOeG+ja0DXCESlqkgf6WRqz7vhMmxzROMyJL+q5g/)
and add yourself to the hackathon waiting list.

We plan to accept conference registrations until we reach the venue capacity.
We will assess late registrations at an interval of ~ 2 weeks and will send out notification emails.
accordingly. For the hackathon, late registrations will be added to the waiting list
and will be notified when there is a change to the application status.
