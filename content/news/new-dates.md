After careful consideration, we have decided to move the meeting earlier by two weeks. ***The new meeting dates are Apr 4-6 2024***.

This move was necessary due to a large trade fair in DÃ¼sseldorf on the original dates. Hotel and apartment availability is already
extremely limited, and for many prohibitively expensive. We gauged the community's feeling before making this decision, and he
majority of speakers and attendees responded favorably to the move, although we do recognize the challenges that this causes for some.
We encourage speakers that find this move problematic to reach out to us and we'll do our best to find a solution together.

As a reminder, if you missed the registration deadline you can
[submit a late registration](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/jnreOeG+ja0DXCESlqkgf6WRqz7vhMmxzROMyJL+q5g/)
and add yourself to the hackathon waiting list.

We look forward to facilitating a productive meeting and memorable experience for all attendees!
