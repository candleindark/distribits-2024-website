## Registration is closed!

Thanks for everyone's registrations and contribution submissions!
It looks like the first distribits meeting is going to be what we hoped for:
An inspiring event for technology enthusiasts with many backgrounds.
We received registrations from Europe, North America, and Asia, from people working on research data curation, climate science, imaging, archeology, data portals, archiving solutions, small and scale large.

We will now work on finalizing the schedule, and send out emails to everyone by November 1st.
If you've missed the deadline but wanted to participate, please stay tuned - we will be able to accommodate late registrations in a short while.
